# FEMA Maps

This repository contains FEMA specific maps and GeoJson files that can be used as layers in your own analysis products.

## FEMA Region GeoJson Files

These files show the FEMA Region boundaries. These files were created from the OpenFEMA API, Regions endpoint: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fema-regions-v2. See the FEMA_Region_GeoJson Jupyter notebook found in the [OpenFEMA Samples, Analysis Examples](https://github.com/FEMA/openfema-samples/tree/master/analysis-examples) repository for the code that generated these files.
